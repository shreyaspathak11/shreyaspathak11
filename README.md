# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub space! I'm a passionate newcomer to web development, driven by a curiosity for technological innovation. Proficient in Python's data structures and algorithms, I enjoy solving complex problems with analytical thinking. Currently exploring the realms of web development, my goal is to evolve into a Full Stack Developer. I thrive on challenges, collaborative learning, and continuous growth.

Check out my ongoing projects that showcase my web development and data structures skills using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). Visit my [portfolio](<https://shreyas-pathak-portfolio.vercel.app/>) for a detailed look.

Have questions, suggestions, or looking to collaborate? Reach out! Whether through GitHub or via email at shreyaspathak.ofc@gmail.com, I'm excited to connect and explore the world of web development together.
Thanks for stopping by! Looking forward to our coding adventures! ðŸš€
