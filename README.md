# Hola amigos! 👋
Welcome to my GitHub space! I'm a passionate developer, driven by a curiosity for technological innovation. Proficient in Python's data structures and algorithms, I enjoy solving complex problems with analytical thinking. Currently exploring the realms of software engineering, my goal is to learn as much as I can. I thrive on challenges, collaborative learning, and continuous growth.

Check out my ongoing projects that showcase my software engineering and data structures skills using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and Flutter(Dart) .
